# Playground project for STM32F3 Discovery 

This project contains basic operations on the STM32F3 Discovery board.
At the moment the program turns on the built-in LEDs via Timer TIM3
interrupts. 
LED_10 can be turned on and off through interrupt via user button.

Initialization was done via CubeMX though I'd like to do most of the post-
start-up initialization manually.
